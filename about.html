            <p>Surya's approach to enhancing BetterHelp involves leveraging physical fitness data to detect signs of mental health and depression. This innovative method goes beyond relying on subjective feelings, providing a more objective and continuous monitoring of your mental well-being. By analyzing your physical fitness data, we can gain valuable insights into your mental state, allowing for early detection of potential issues and facilitating timely interventions.</p> 

            <p>One of the key benefits of this approach is that it eliminates the need for individuals to answer extensive questionnaires or surveys. Instead, the process is seamlessly integrated into your daily life, making it a convenient and non-intrusive way to monitor your mental health.</p> 
                
            <p>At Surya, we prioritize your privacy and data security.
